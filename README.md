## Overview of the Project

In the realm of computational modeling, we introduce the concept of smart agents—entities characterized by their intelligence, adaptability, and computational prowess. Traditionally, humans have been considered the archetypal smart agents. However, the emergence of foundation models—equipped with sophisticated language, vision, and reasoning capabilities that mimic human behavior—has revolutionized our approach to agent-based modeling (ABM).

This paradigm shift has given rise to our project on [**smart agent-based modeling (SABM)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06330), where foundation models act as agents, and models are constructed using natural language. SABM transcends the limitations of conventional ABM by integrating these advanced models, thereby providing a more nuanced and realistic framework for understanding complex systems.

The **Modularization-Boosted Agent Simulator (MBAS)** leverages the principles of SABM to explore and analyze natural processes across diverse domains such as economics, behavioral science, and beyond. By modularizing the components of agent-based simulations, MBAS enhances flexibility, scalability, and the depth of analysis, offering a powerful tool for researchers and practitioners alike.

We believe that SABM, as implemented in MBAS, represents a significant advancement in the study of natural systems. It facilitates a deeper comprehension of these systems by capturing the intricacies and adaptive behaviors of smart agents, ultimately leading to more informed and effective decision-making.
